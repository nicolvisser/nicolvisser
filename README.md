- 👋 Hi, I’m Nicol Visser
- 🎓 I’m currently pursuing a PhD degree in Electronic Engineering at Stellenbosch University, South Africa
- 📃 My research is on finding low bitrate discrete representations for speech that can be used for spoken language modeling and help support under-resourced languages

⚠️ Some of my repositories and `torch.hub` models have recently been made private while I wait for reviews on a paper.
